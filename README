The pxa-impedance-matcher is a 3rd stage loader that is used to boot
legacy hardware that has a bootloader which is unable to boot DT kernels.

It acts as chain loader which determines the correct hardware type and DTB
blob.

It's completetly specific to PXA3xx based Raumfeld hardware, and no attempt
has been made to keep the code flexible or generic. It should, however, be
easily possible to modify the code base in order to make it work on other
boards.
