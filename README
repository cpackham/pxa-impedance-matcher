The pxa-impedance-matcher is a 3rd stage loader that is used to boot
legacy hardware that has a bootloader which is unable to boot DT kernels.

It acts as chain loader which determines the correct hardware type and DTB
blob.

It used to be completetly specific to PXA3xx based Raumfeld hardware, but
was turned into a more generic kind of framework recently.

WARNING: PLEASE ONLY USE THIS TOOL AS A LAST RESORT OPTION FOR LEGACY
HARDWARE, AND NOT AS AN OPTION FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS. THE CLEARLY ADVISED
WAY IS TO ADD PROPER DTB SUPPORT TO YOUR BOOTLOADER.
